# spoticode

Spoticode is a fully-featured Spotify Web Client where the only interface is a javascript console.

## Motivation

We hope to see spoticode become a way for music-lovers who otherwise would not be programming to discover the joys of
coding.

## Project Status

This was the result of HooHacks 2019, a 24-hour hackathon at the University of Virginia. The project is still underdevelopment
and is in prototype status.
